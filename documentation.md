## 1. Background

Climate change is one of the **greatest** challenges that the world faces today. By simple definition, climate change is when normal climate patterns become abnormal and this can affect parts of the Earth. 
Whilst global warming specifically refers to an increase in the average global temperate, climate change refers to the effect that this increase has on the climate.
Climate change has mostly been caused by humans through activities such as burning fossil fuels and using land for cities and farms etc.

The World Economic Forum's Global Shapers Survey 2017 surveyed 31,000 18-to-35-year-olds from 186 different countries. 48.8% of them believed that climate change was their biggest concern.
The website that has been created aims to solve the climate change problem through education and promotion.
